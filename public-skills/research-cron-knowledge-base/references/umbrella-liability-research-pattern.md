# Umbrella Liability Research Pattern

Condensed reference for umbrella/excess liability insurance research in wealth planning. Load when researching ANY umbrella liability, excess liability, personal umbrella, or P&C insurance topic.

## Carrier Hierarchy (by client profile)

| Tier | Limit Range | Carriers | Typical Premium ($/yr per $1M) |
|------|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Standard | $1M-$5M | GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, Allstate | $200-$300 |
| Upper-Middle | $2M-$10M | State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, USAA | $150-$250 |
| HNW | $2M-$25M | Chubb, Cincinnati, Nationwide Private Client | $120-$200 |
| Ultra-HNW | $10M-$100M+ | Chubb, PURE, AIG Private Client Group, Berkshire Hathaway Guard | $100-$180 |

## Underlying Limit Requirements (carrier-mandatory)

- **Auto:** 250/500/100 minimum ($250K BI per person / $500K BI per accident / $100K PD)
- **Home:** $300K personal liability minimum
- **Critical:** If underlying limits fall below carrier minimums at claim time, umbrella may NOT respond — this is the #1 coverage gap.

## Recommended Limit Formula

```
base_limit = net_worth + (annual_income * 3)
risk_multiplier = 1.0 + (teen_drivers * 0.25) + (pool ? 0.15 : 0) + (dogs_high_risk ? 0.25 : 0) + (rentals * 0.20) + (professional_risk ? 0.15 : 0)
climate_adj = {low: 0.85, medium: 1.0, high: 1.25, extreme: 1.50}
recommended = round_up_to_standard_tier(base_limit * risk_multiplier * climate_adj)
```

Standard tiers: $1M, $2M, $3M, $5M, $7.5M, $10M, $15M, $20M, $25M, $50M

## State Jury Climate (5-tier)
