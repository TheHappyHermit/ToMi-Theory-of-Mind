# Graphify Refresh Pitfall: AST-Only Produces 0-Edge Graphs

## Problem

The cron-based `refresh_graphify.py` script runs `graphify update` which performs **incremental AST-only extraction**. For markdown wiki corpora, this produces graphs with:

- **Nodes**: extracted from file structure/frontmatter
- **Edges**: **0** — no semantic relationships
- **Communities**: **0** — no clustering

The graph.json exists, has nodes, but is functionally useless for relationship queries because there are no edges connecting concepts.

**On the original evidence for this:** an earlier version of this note cited node and edge
counts read from one developer's local install. Those figures are personal derived data and
do not belong in a shared repository. More importantly, the "0 edges" reading was **wrong**:
graphify stores relationships under a `links` key, which that measurement did not check, so it
reported zero for graphs that in fact carried tens of thousands of relationships. The
observation that mattered, and which anyone can reproduce, is the mechanism: incremental
`update` yields structural extraction only, and a semantic cache left unmerged contributes no
relationships to `graph.json`.

To check a real installation, run `scripts/graphify_health.py` from the repository root. It
reads both `edges` and `links`, reports the edge-to-node ratio, and exits non-zero on a graph
that cannot be traversed.

## Root Cause

`graphify update` is designed for code repos where AST extraction captures function calls, imports, and structural relationships. For markdown wikis, the meaningful content — relationships between concepts, semantic connections across pages — requires **semantic (LLM-based) extraction**, not structural extraction.

The refresh cron does:
```bash
graphify update <source> --graph <output>  # AST only for markdown
```

It never runs:
```bash
graphify extract <source> --backend openai --model <model> --no-cluster
```

The full extract with semantic backend is what builds edges and communities from document content.

## Solution

### Full Semantic Run (Required for Wikis)

```bash
rm -rf <output>/cache/semantic  # clear cache — MANDATORY for full re-extraction
graphify extract <source> \
  --backend openai \
  --model <model-id> \
  --token-budget 50000 \
  --max-concurrency 4 \
  --no-cluster \
  --out <output>
```

Model recommendation: use the same model used historically (Qwen 3.6-35B or Quinn 3.6-6). For local models, configure `OPENAI_API_KEY=local` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

### Incremental (AST-only) — Acceptable Only for Code

`graphify update` is fine for code-heavy repos where AST captures the relationships. For wikis with predominantly markdown text, it produces useless graphs.

## Verification

After any refresh, verify:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
d = json.loads(open('<output>/graph.json').read())
print(f'Nodes: {len(d.get(\"nodes\",[]))}, Edges: {len(d.get(\"edges\",[]))}, Communities: {len(d.get(\"communities\",{}))}')
assert len(d.get('edges',[])) > 0, 'Graph has no edges — extraction failed'
"
```

**Success indicators**: edges > 0, communities > 0, edge-to-node ratio > 0.1 for wikis.

## Cadence Recommendations

| Corpus | Size | Full Semantic | Incremental |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------|
| Active Wiki | ~226 files | Weekly | Daily |
| Oracle Brain | ~2,482 files | Monthly/Quarterly | Daily |
| Code repos | Any | On schema change | Every update |

The oracle brain at 2,482 files would take hours to days for a full semantic run with a local model. Monthly/quarterly is more realistic than weekly.
