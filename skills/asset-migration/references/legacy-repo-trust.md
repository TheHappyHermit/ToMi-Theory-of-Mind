# Case Study: Legacy Repo → Hermes Brain Image Migration

> **Note:** This case study refers to the old repo name ("Hermes Cortex" / `hermes-cortex/`) which has been renamed to "Hermes Brain". This document is kept for historical reference.

## Problem
The user uploaded new images to the legacy repo that were meant to replace text boxes in the `hermes-repo/` README. Instead of adding the new images, I blindly copied ALL files from the legacy `assets/` into `hermes-repo/assets/`, overwriting the user's newer "Hermes Brain"-branded images with older "Hermes Cortex"-branded versions.

## What Went Wrong
- Assumed files in the legacy repo were newer versions of the same content
- Didn't compare file sizes or verify content before copying
- Didn't check which images were actually new vs. existing
- Replaced 9 images with older versions (different sizes confirmed different versions)
- The result: images in the README all showed "Hermes Cortex" branding instead of "Hermes Brain"

## Resolution
1. Found `hermes-clean/` directory that had the correct versions (created as a backup)
2. Copied correct versions from `hermes-clean/assets/` back to `hermes-repo/assets/`
3. Reverted bad git commits with `git reset --hard 4810638`
4. Force-pushed to restore clean state: `git push origin main --force`

## Key Files Involved
- Source (legacy, DO NOT blindly copy): `~/hermes-cortex/assets/` (old name)
- Target: `~/hermes-repo/assets/`
- Backup of correct versions: `~/hermes-clean/assets/`
- README before changes: `git show 4810638:README.md`

## Lesson
Always inventory both sides, compare file sizes, and verify content before any cross-repo copy. New images should be ADDED, not used to overwrite existing ones.
