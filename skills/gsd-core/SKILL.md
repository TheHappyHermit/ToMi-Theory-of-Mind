# gsd-core — Git. Ship. Done.

## What is gsd-core

gsd-core is an open-source, MIT-licensed toolkit for steering coding agents with structured discipline. It splits work into five phases (discuss, plan, execute, verify, ship) and delegates heavy lifting to subagents that each start with a clean context.

It's a meta-prompting, context-engineering, and spec-driven development system that routes whichever model provider you configure. Instead of one generic assistant trying to do everything, gsd-core provides a repeatable loop with durable markdown artifacts and quality gates at every boundary.

**Key principles:**
- **Spec before code** — clarify WHAT before discussing HOW
- **Phase isolation** — each phase has clear inputs, outputs, and exit criteria
- **Durable artifacts** — every phase produces markdown that persists across sessions
- **Quality gates** — verification is built into the workflow, not bolted on
- **Subagent delegation** — heavy work spawns in clean contexts to avoid pollution

**Repository:** https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core

## When to use gsd-core

Use gsd-core when Coder needs to:
- Initialize a new project with deep context gathering
- Onboard an existing codebase into a structured workflow
- Break work into phases with clear acceptance criteria
- Run spec-driven development with Socratic questioning
- Map an existing codebase for understanding
- Execute a phase with wave-based parallelization
- Verify work meets acceptance criteria before shipping
- Manage multiple workstreams or workspaces
- Run ad-hoc tasks with GSD quality guarantees

**Default preference:** When a coding task involves project initialization, phase management, or spec-driven development, prefer gsd-core over generic Coder prompts.

## Namespace Routers

Six namespace routers serve as first-stage entry points. They keep the skill-listing token cost low (~120 tokens for 6 routers vs ~2,150 for a flat listing) while every concrete sub-skill remains directly invocable.

| Router | Routes to |
|---|---|
| `/gsd-workflow` | Phase pipeline — discuss / plan / execute / verify / phase / progress / next |
| `/gsd-project` | Project lifecycle — milestones, audits, summary |
| `/gsd-quality` | Quality gates — code review, debug, audit, security, eval, ui |
| `/gsd-context` | Codebase intelligence — map, graphify, docs, learnings |
| `/gsd-manage` | Management — config, workspace, workstreams, thread, update, ship, inbox |
| `/gsd-ideate` | Exploration & capture — explore, sketch, spike, spec, capture |

## Phase Loop

The core GSD workflow is a five-phase loop:

```
spec → discuss → plan → execute → verify
```

1. **Spec** — Clarify WHAT through Socratic questioning. Edge coverage probe. Prohibition coverage probe. Produce SPEC.md.
2. **Discuss** — Gather phase context through adaptive questioning. Produce CONTEXT.md.
3. **Plan** — Research the domain, plan the implementation, verify the plan. Produce RESEARCH.md, PLAN.md, VALIDATION.md.
4. **Execute** — Execute plans with wave-based parallelization. Produce SUMMARY.md, git commits.
5. **Verify** — Verify phase meets acceptance criteria. Produce VERIFICATION.md.

After verification passes, ship the phase and move to the next one.

## the operator-Specific Rules

1. **Use /gsd-new-project for any new repo/service.** Do not skip project initialization.
2. **Use /gsd-onboard for onboarding existing codebases.** The codebase map is essential for understanding.
3. **Dark-themed glassmorphism UI is default for any UI work.** When /gsd-ui-phase generates design contracts, specify dark theme with glassmorphism effects.
4. **Always verify UI changes in browser.** Use /gsd-ui-review or browser verification, not just syntax checks.
5. **PII scrubbing required before any commit.** Ensure no personal data, API keys, or credentials are in the code.
6. **Prefer deterministic workflows over agents.** GSD's phase loop provides structure — use it rather than ad-hoc prompting.

## Consultation Protocol

When Coder encounters a question requiring "taste" (what the operator would prefer), it should ask the main Hermes agent via structured handoff rather than guessing.

### Handoff Template
```
[CONSULTATION REQUEST]
Context: [what Coder is working on]
Question: [specific question requiring the operator's taste/preference]
Options considered: [list options]
Impact: [how this affects the deliverable]
```

### Process
1. Coder identifies a decision requiring the operator's taste/preference
2. Coder fills out the handoff template and sends to main Hermes agent
3. Main Hermes agent consults memory, Honcho, Active Wiki for relevant preferences
4. Main Hermes agent responds with a recommendation and rationale
5. Coder proceeds with the recommendation (or escalates to the operator if still unclear)

### Examples of taste decisions
- Color palette or visual style choices
- Layout preferences (sidebar vs topnav, card vs list)
- Feature prioritization when scope is constrained
- Tone of voice for copy
- Animation/transition preferences
